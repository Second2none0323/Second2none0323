## Personal Motto and Favorite Quote

"Always do your best in whatever you do; set goals and seek challenges; become a role model for those coming behind you; and always have God in your heart." - Charles F. Bolden

## Objective

My respect for technology and awe of the power it holds has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity.  I am currently gaining hands-on experience in a small closed-SOC environment-- eager to transition into a role in a much larger and more complex environmet where I can continue to grow and contribute.
